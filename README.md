# Java MVC

Java MVC (**javamvc**) is intended to be a simple library of classes to manage simple applications. It attempts to follow a _Model-View-Controller (MVC)_ framework, but may not fully adhere to best practices as far as the framework is concerned. There are several MVC frameworks out there for web applications such as [Spring][1], but there aren't many for desktop applications ([JIDE JDAF][2] is one I have come across).

_This is a work in progress, and may change radically between releases. I do not plan on supporting methods that I have deprecated or find no use for._

## Overview
